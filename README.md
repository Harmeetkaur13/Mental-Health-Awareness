## About
The Mental Health Awareness website is a resource hub aimed at providing users with easily accessible, beginner-friendly information and support for mental health. The goal is to create an inclusive, empathetic, and informative platform where people can learn about mental health issues, find helpful tips, and explore available resources for support.

This is how my website looks on [https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://harmeetkaur13.github.io/Mental-Health-Awareness/)

Here is how it looks [Mental Health Awareness Image](assets/readmefiles/amiresponsive.png)

### External User‚Äôs Goal:
The user seeks accessible, beginner-friendly information on mental health, including how to recognize common issues and manage stress, presented in a supportive and organised layout.

### Site Owner‚Äôs Goal: 
The site owner wants to create a welcoming webpage that provides basic mental health information using a clean and supportive design. The focus is on using HTML and CSS with Bootstrap to create a calming and well-organised user experience.

### Potential Features might Include:
Hero Section with Positive Messaging: A Bootstrap Jumbotron with an encouraging message about mental health, using a calming colour scheme and a simple background image.
Information Cards: Use Bootstrap‚Äôs card components to present mental health tips and common issues, providing a visually appealing way to organise content.
Resource Links: A grid layout for external links to mental health resources styled with Bootstrap buttons to make them stand out.
Positive Affirmations: Use Bootstrap‚Äôs text utilities to include a section with uplifting quotes or messages to encourage users.


## Design

I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to import my fonts.


### Wireframess

## Features
### Hero Section: 
A visually appealing welcome message introducing mental health awareness.
### Mental Health Issues & Tips: 
A dedicated section for tips and insights on mental wellbeing.
###Resources Section: 
Information about external organizations and support networks.
###Responsive Design: 
Optimized for use across different screen sizes and devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).

The website aims to provide a user-friendly experience, helping individuals feel supported and informed about mental health.

### Accessibility

In my project I have added aria-labels and names to all my links and buttons to enable screen readers to understand each element. I have run a lighthouse test and a wave test to ensure I have met the requirements needed to be accessible friendly.
